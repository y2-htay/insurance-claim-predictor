#  Readme:
> ### Notebook is where main artificial intelligence code is, so all cells will need to be run to train and analyse a new model

> ### So for example when you need to update the dataset, just replace the exisitng dataset and remove the tuner_results folder (stores old hyperparameters) and run every cell in the notebook, this will re-train the neural network and also retune the hyperparameters
