# Insurance-Claim-Predictor
## In-order to run this project please do the following:
<ol>
<li>If using an IDE set the focus folder to Insurance-Claim-Project</li>
<li>Make sure docker desktop is running</li>
<li>I'd recomend running clean_build_and_run.py to allow for our project to
run on a clean slate  be minded that this will delete any
docker images and containers you previously had</li>
<li>Go to 127.0.0.1:8000 and the website should be working</li>
</ol>
